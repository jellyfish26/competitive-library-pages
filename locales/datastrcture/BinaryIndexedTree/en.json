        "overview": "BIT is a data structure in which the sum of a certain interval can be obtained by $O(log{N})$.",
        "explanation_content": "BIT, also called Fenwick tree, is a data structure that can be used to add values to a sequence of numbers and to find the interval sum in $O(log{N})$, that is, in logarithmic time. Compared to segment trees, the implementation is simpler and the constant times are lighter.",
